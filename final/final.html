    <h1>Final Project: Cat-Proof Charging Station 🐱⚡ </h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>At home, I have a designated charging corner where all my charging cables and plugged-in devices are stored inside a box. However, my cat loves playing around this area, which poses serious risks like electric shocks or chewing on wires, potentially damaging both the devices and the cat’s safety. I want to build a cat-proof charging station that detects when my cat gets too close and activates a gentle deterrent (such as LED warnings, a buzzer, or vibrations) to keep them away safely and effectively.</p>
