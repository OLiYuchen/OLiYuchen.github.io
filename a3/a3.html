    <h1>Assignment 3: Input Output Interaction!</h1>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I created a circuit with three LEDs that light up in sequence
      based on the light intensity detected by a photoresistor. Below, you can find the
      schematic, circuit setup, firmware code, and answers to the additional questions.
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Schematic & Voltage Divider Resistance Calculation</h2>
    <br><img src="IO_Schematics.jpg" alt="Schematic for LED Circuit" />
    <p><br>
      This is the schematic of my LED circuit. The photoresistor is connected as part of a
      voltage divider to pin A0, with a fixed resistor of 10kΩ. Each LED (blue) is
      connected to a 220Ω resistor for current limiting and connected to digital pins 9, 10, and 11.
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>LED Resistance Calculation</h2>
    <br><img src="IO_Resistance.jpg" alt="LED Resistance Calculation" />
    <p><br>
      For each LED circuit, 220Ω resistor was chosen for brightness and safety. The
      resistors were calculated using Ohm's Law, as shown below.
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Circuit Implementation</h2>
    <br><img src="IO_firmware.jpg" alt="Circuit on Breadboard" />
    <p><br>
      This is the breadboard setup of my circuit. The photoresistor voltage is measured at
      A0, and the three blue LEDs are controlled through pins 9, 10, and 11. The circuit
      uses 220Ω resistors for the LEDs and a 10kΩ fixed resistor for the
      photoresistor. For clearity, blue wires are used to connect the blue LEDs to pins while black wires are used to connect the GND side. White wire is where A0 is connected.
    </p>

    <h2>Firmware</h2>
    <pre><code>int photopin = A0; // Photoresistor connected to A0
int led1 = 9;      // First blue LED connected to pin 9
int led2 = 10;     // Second blue LED connected to pin 10
int led3 = 11;     // Third blue LED connected to pin 11

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);             // Start serial monitor
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);          // Set LED pins to output
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int R_position = analogRead(photopin); // Read input from photoresistor
  int val = constrain(R_position, 400, 650); // Restrain to 400–650
  R_position = map(val, 400, 650, 0, 255);   // Map to 0–255

  if (R_position < 50) { // First LED only
    int R_low = map(R_position, 0, 50, 0, 255); // Map to enlarge gradual brightness effect
    analogWrite(led1, R_low); // Led1 gradual brightness
    analogWrite(led2, 0);
    analogWrite(led3, 0);
  } else if (R_position >= 50 && R_position < 150) { // First and second LEDs
    int R_medium = map(R_position, 50, 150, 0, 255); // Map to enlarge gradual brightness effect
    analogWrite(led1, 255); // Led1 max brightness
    analogWrite(led2, R_medium); // Led2 gradual brightness
    analogWrite(led3, 0);
  } else if (R_position >= 150 && R_position <= 255) { // All LEDs
    int R_high = map(R_position, 150, 255, 0, 255); // Map to enlarge gradual brightness effect
    analogWrite(led1, 255); // Led1 max brightness
    analogWrite(led2, 255); // Led2 max brightness
    analogWrite(led3, R_high); // Led3 gradual brightness
  }

  Serial.print("photo: "); // Debugging output
  Serial.println(R_position);
  delay(100);
}
    </code></pre>
    <p><br>
      This firmware reads the photoresistor value, maps it to PWM values, and adjusts the
      brightness of the LEDs accordingly. Each line is commented for clarity.

    <h2>Animated GIF of Operation</h2>
    <br><img src="IO.gif" alt="Circuit Operation Animation" />
    <p><br>
      This animated GIF demonstrates the operation of the circuit. The LEDs light up or fade in
      sequence gradually with increasing or decreasing brightness as the light intensity on the photoresistor increases/decreases.
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
    <br><br>
        <h3>1: Can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2?</h3>
        <img src="IO_Q1.jpg" alt="Variable Resistor as R1 or R2" />
        <p>
          Technically, the variable resistor can be either R1 or R2. When the photoresistor is R1,
          the output voltage increases with brightness. When it is R2, the output voltage
          decreases with brightness. The configuration depends on the desired behavior, as
          shown in the calculations above. 
          <br><br>
          However, with my current code configuration, the photoresistor
          is R1, so the output voltage increases with brightness and LEDs light up with teh increase of brightness.
        </p>

        <h3>2: Voltage Over Time Graph</h3>
        <img src="IO_Q2.jpg" alt="Voltage Over Time Graph" />
        <p>
          This graph shows the voltage at V<sub>measure</sub> over time as the light
          intensity on the photoresistor changes. The X-axis represents time, and the
          Y-axis represents voltage.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>3: 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead</h3>
        <p><br>
          <li>Current Configuration:</li>
          AnalogWrite (PWM): 8-bit → Values range from 0 to 255.
          <br> AnalogRead (ADC): 10-bit → Values range from 0 to 1023.
          <li>New Configuration With 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit ADC:</li>
            AnalogWrite (PWM): 10-bit → Values range from 0 to 1023.
            <br>AnalogRead (ADC): 16-bit → Values range from 0 to 65535.
          <br><br>With 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit ADC, the `map()` function would need to accommodate
          the increased resolution. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code><br> R_position = map(val, 16384, 32768, 0, 1023);</code></pre>
        <p><br>
          Here, the ADC range is mapped to the 10-bit PWM range. This provides finer
          control over both input sensitivity and LED brightness.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
